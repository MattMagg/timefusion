Open-Source Hybrid Forecasting System (OSHFS) is a Python library that combines statistical methods with deep learning approaches for time series forecasting. This project provides a unified framework that leverages both traditional statistical methods and modern deep learning approaches.

Key Features
-----------

- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines statistical and deep learning methods in a unified framework
- **Ready-to-Use Models**: Implementations of ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, LSTM, and ensemble models
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Tools for data cleaning, imputation, normalization, and feature engineering
- **Evaluation Framework**: Comprehensive metrics and backtesting utilities
- **Extensibility**: Clear extension points for custom implementations
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Core functionality requires only widely-used libraries
